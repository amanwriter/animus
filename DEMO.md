# Animus Demo

> Note: The hack is hosted on AWS and requires an HTTPS server but only has a self-signed certificate. Thus, you'll be prompted with a 'Your connection is not private' error whenever you open the pages, and you'll have to agree to proceed forward.
> Depending on the latency, the media download/upload speeds (especially in Admin) will vary significantly and your patience is appreciated. In production, these resources would be moved to a separate dedicated faster server.

## Admin Portal

- Navigate to https://ec2-35-154-242-18.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/admin/index.html to explore the Admin portal

## Reader

- Navigate to https://ec2-35-154-242-18.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/reader.html to open the Reader to view all the published pages. It is preferable to open this on a large screen like a laptop.

## Viewer

- Navigate to https://ec2-35-154-242-18.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/viewer/index.html on your smartphone and point the camera at the page opened on the Reader component. Also ensure that all markers are captured in the video feed. You should be able to view and interact with the triggers shortly.

> Note: In case you face performance issues on your low-end smartphone, you can also reverse the reader and viewer, by opening the Reader page in landscape mode on your smartphone and the Viewer page on your laptop. Display your smartphone screen to the laptop's webcam.

> Note: The demo has been tested on Chrome for both the Reader and Viewer components (for both mobile and PC browser) and Admin portal has been tested on Chrome for PC browsers only.
